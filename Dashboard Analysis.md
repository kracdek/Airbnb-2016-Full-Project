Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locations.
In this dashboard analysis, I will be providing some statistics based on data analysed for Airbnb data collected Seattle.

Letâ€™s begin by asking questions and interpreting results of the analysis.

## 1. What is the most busiest time of the year?
What most host and user might ask themselves is when is the most convenient time of the year to rent an Airbnb in Seattle. The busiest time means an increase in revenue for Airbnb hosts
For this analysis we are going to focus on two main features: Price and how many properties were rented in that month of the year. This is because we want to get the best value for money and also have different options to choose from.

With this in mind we can see that during December, the prices are the highest, hence the busiest time of the year summer considering Chrismas and New Year.The second most busiest time is during summer, in June and then in August.

## 2. What is zipcode has the highest average price?
One of the most frequently asked question when going on vacations is in which area to rent and how much it cost.
To answer this question we are going to use the data from the listing dataset.
For this case, we will be analyzing the price for each area. It must be pointed out that the best areas to rent have many other factors involved. This might be because of what different user consider import in a good location. Maybe some are near the cost, other near the city centre or maybe others are closer to where the nightlife is. Whether airbnb host will make more revenue depends of these factors, aside from the pricing. All these are good question for deeper analysis with more data about the city of Seattle.

As we can observe, the zipcode 98134 area has the highest average price of $206.6. The follow up higest zipcodes can be shown in this chart:

 It is important to pointed out that the best areas to rent have many other factors involved. This might be because of what different user consider import in a good location.

 ## 3. What is the distribution of listings per bedroom?
 By analyzing the chart below, is can be seen that the lower the number of bedrooms, the higher the listing. For example, there were fewer listings for s 6 bedroom rental, whereas a 1 bedroom rental has the most, as demonstrated in this chart:

 ## 4. What is the correlation between the average cost and the number of bedrooms?
 Unlike the previous analysis, the higher the bedrrom count the more expensive the cost will be. When you analyze the chart below, 6 bedrooms rental has the highest average price of $584.8 whereas 1 bedroom only goes for $96.2.

## Conclusion
As we can see there are many questions that we can ask ourselves about the data from Airbnb, some of them might have a logical conclusion while others sometimes not as we could see in question 1
